;;; related-files.el --- Work with @related file annotations  -*- lexical-binding:t -*-

;; Author: Sarah Stoltze <sstoltze@gmail.com>
;; Version: 1.0
;; Keywords: convenience, files, hypermedia
;; URL: https://github.com/sstoltze/related-files
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4"))


;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides support for working with related file annotations.
;; The annotations are described in more detail at https://github.com/synchronal/related-files.
;;
;; An annotation starts with @related, followed by one or more Markdown-style links consisting
;; of an arbitrary name (e.g., "test", "css", "header") and a path to the file:
;; @related [name](path)
;; The path is either relative to the current file (if it starts with a "."),
;; or to the project root otherwise.
;; The annotation ends with a newline character.
;; The following are all valid annotations.
;;
;; A very simple annotation:
;; @related [test](/related-files-test.el)
;;
;; Annotation lines can contain several related files
;; See @related [test](/src/related.test.js), [test](/src/other.test.js), and [css](/assets/style.css)
;;
;; And can span multiple lines
;; @related \
;;   [test](/test/core/foo_test.exs) \
;;   [test](/test/integration/bar_test.exs) \
;;   [sass](/assets/css/foo.sass)
;;
;; The package currently supports scanning for annotations and navigating between them.
